= Power =
The [http://www.irobot.com/filelibrary/pdfs/hrd/create/Create%20Open%20Interface_v2.pdf iRobot Create's Cargo Bay Connector] provide battery ground and voltage in order to power additional sensors and peripherals. We utilized the Create's battery voltage (~16V) to power the [http://beagleboard.org/ BeagleBoard-xM] (5V). The [http://beagleoncreate.googlecode.com/svn/GpioPowerAddon/GpioPowerAddon.pdf GPIO Power Addon board] has voltage converter to convert 16V power down to both 5V and 12V. In this case, we grab pin 10 (Switched Vpwr) and pin 21 (GND) from the Create Cargo Bay Connector and feed it into [http://beagleoncreate.googlecode.com/svn/GpioPowerAddon/GpioPowerAddon.pdf GPIO Power Addon board] to produce 5V power for the [http://beagleboard.org/ BeagleBoard-xM].
